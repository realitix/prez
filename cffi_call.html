        <p>- Welcome everyone, I'm glad to be here with you.</p>
        <p>- I'm Jean-Sébastien Bevilacqua, I work at Linagora, a great company that promotes free software and it's this company which encouraged me to give this talk.</p>
        <p>- If I give this talk today, it's because I truly believe in CFFI to improve maintainability and robustness of Python extension.</p>
        <p>- I want to share with you my experience in order to convince you to give a try to CFFI next time you need to write a Python extension.</p>

    <h1>Why Python extension ?</h1>
    <section>
        <aside class="notes">
            <p>- But first, why do we need Python extension ? I'm going to tell you my use case.</p>
            <p>- Approximatly one year ago, the new Vulkan API was released. </p>
            <p>- Vulkan is the new graphic API that will replace OpenGL</p>
            <p> Back at this time, I was enjoying OpenGL development and with Vulkan, I saw an opportunity to improve my 3d and low level knowledge.</p>

        <p>- As you may know, Vulkan is a low level API and in order to use it, you have to call low levels functions like dlopen and dlsym.</p>

    <h1 style="color: white; text-align:left"><i>I'm totally lost <br />with <br />CPython API</i></h1>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>To write a Python extension in C, you have to make use of the CPython API. It allows you to create module, add functions and classes in it.</p>
        <p>After reading the very good CPython API, I started my C extension, it was clear and I felt self confident, But... it stills C!</p>
        <p>We have to fight again malloc and free like usual, but, because it's too easy, CPython API adds the reference counting and a cumbersome API.</p>
        <p>I almost give up several times due to the amount of work...</p>
        <p>We are going to see existing solutions to resolve complexity of C extension but let's see ABI/API mode before</p>
    </aside>

    <h2 style="font-size:1.4em"><i>Application </i><span style="font-size:1.15em; color: red">binary</span> <i>interface</i></h2>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>- From now, I will often use ABI / API words so I need to explain clearly what I mean by theses terms.</p>
        <p>- ABI means Application Binary Interface and API means Application Programming Interface.</p>
        <p>- The API mode is what humans use, when you call a function, you need to know the name of the function and arguments to pass.</p>
        <p>- So as a PROGRAMMING interface, it's all expressed in source code.</p>
        <p>- The ABI is very similar, think of it as a compiled version of the API.</p>
    </aside>

<section>
    <h1>Why ABI ?</h1>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>- To be clear, when you write the program, you use the human API, then, when your program is compiled, computer will access the ABI of the library.</p>
        <p>- Maybe... You wonder the goal of ABI mode from a human point of view, we could just stick to the usual API mode.</p>
        <p>- Accessing a library with ABI mode allows you to dynamically link at runtime, and thus can be used with an interpreted language without compilation.</p>
        <p>- You have to really understand this part, it's the only tricky part needed to fully exploit CFFI potential.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
            <p>The first one is Cython</p>
            <p>cython use an interesting approach, it can execute directly your Python code and you can add new syntaxes elements by iteration.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
            <p>- It's very good but when you start to add custom cython syntax, your Python code is no more Python and so you loose portability and cython becomes a required dependancy.</p>
            <p>- You should take that into account before using it.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
            <p> - Another solution is ctypes</p>
            <p>- ctypes is a builtin, it's a good point because you can be sure ctypes is always available.</p>
            <p>- With ctypes, you don't need compilation, it works on the ABI mode.</p>
            <p>- You dynamically link to a library during runtime.</p>

# Initialize Point[2] argument
points_array = (Point * 2)((1, 2), (3, 4))

vector_size_fn = lib.vector_size

print('out = {}'.format(size))</code></pre>

        <aside class="notes">
            <p>- Like you can see on screen, to use ctypes, you need to learn a new API.</p>
            <p>- You have to transle your C header to the ctypes API.</p>
            <p>- In this example, I declare a Point struct and get back the vector_size function from the library</p>

        <div style="color: blue">
        <p>Seven years ago, two smart people, Armin Rigo and Maciej Fijałkowski created CFFI.</p>
        <p>You may know theses names since they authored PyPy too, not a piece of cake!</p>
        <p>For information Pypy is an alternative Python interpreter with a JIT.</p>
        <p>At first CFFI was an alternative to ctypes, it was working only in ABI mode, later the API mode was added and revolutionize Python extensions ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Before CFFI, to create an API mode extension for Python, you had to use the CPython C API or cython which only work with CPython.</p>
        <p>With Cffi, extensions are working with CPython 2.x/3.x/PyPy without changing a line of your code!</p>
        </div>
        <div style="color: green">
            <p>Now you understand ABI and API mode, I can show you how it works with cffi.</p>
            <p>But let's introduce another concept of cffi, this one is a lot simpler than ABI and API modes.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="color: red">
            <p>In the in-line mode, everything is set up every time you import your Python code.</p>
            <p>In the out-of-line mode, you have a separate step of preparation (and possibly compilation) that produces a module which your main program can then import.</p>
            <p>Of course, in-line mode is available only for ABI mode since API mode always requires compilation.</p>

C.printf("hello %s\n", arg)</code></pre>
        <aside class="notes">
            <p>This first example shows how to work with ABI and in-line mode.</p>
            <p>This is the first feature supported by cffi and it's exactly what ctypes is done for.</p>
            <p>Like you can see, with cffi, you just pass the C header to cdef and open your library, that's all !</p>
            <p>Magic... Cffi syntax is clean, intuitive.</p>
            <p>With ctypes you declare manually the library structure, thanks but no thanks ctypes!</p>

        <h1>DEMO</h1>
        <aside class="notes">
            <p>On this example, with dlopen(None), I load the entire C namespace which contains printf function</p>
            <p>To let cffi knows this function, I have to give it with cdef.
            <p>Then I create a char argument and I can pass it to the printf function</p>
            <p>I use pdb to do it in front of you</p>
            <p>My terminal session is at the pdb point in the program</p>
            <p>Let's print !</p>
            <p>It works!, The number is the value returned by the function printf</p>

    <p>cffi goes one step further with its API mode.</p>
    <p>Syntax stills similar but you can notice a difference, we pass C code to cffi with "set_source" function.</p>
    <p>Then you just ask cffi to compile your module.</p>
    <p>Your Python extension is robust, fast and easy to maintain.</p>
    <p>With this API mode, you can't have segmentation fault due to a mismatching ABI.</p>
    <p> Moreover, it adds a convenient features, you can replace useless value by three dot but I will not go into detail on this feature.</p>

            <p>Like you can see on your right, in the source, we just includes pwd and types</p>
            <p>In the cdef, we don't need to add all pwd functions, just the ones we want to use</p>
            <p>So here we use only two functions and we don't need all fields of passwd struct</p>

        <p>Constant is the easier part and both case are simple:</p>
        <p>In C we just use the CPython API to add constant to our module BUT we have to take care about variable type.</p>

        <p>- In init, you have to parse each parameter with CPython utils function.</p>
        <p>- And in Get, you have to convert C struct to Python object</p>

        <p>- I usually create a folder dedicated to cffi named _cffi_build and I recommand you to do so to keep a clean separation of concerns.</p>
        <p>- shaderc.h contains shaderc function signatures and structs, we just copy/paste the header provided by google and cffi handles it.</p>
        <p>- pyshaderc_build is used to generate the Python extension</p>
        <p>- Next we have the pyshader folder containing our wrapper and finally we'll take a look at the setup file with a special cffi feature.</p>

    <aside class="notes">
        <p>- With theses few lines, we tell cffi to compile the source with statically linked library 'shaderc_combined' and to name the extension _pyshaderc.</p>
        <p>- shaderc_combined is a static library that we have to compile before running this cffi part.</p>
        <p>- I don't show you how because it's not directly related to cffi.</p>
        <p>- Like you can see, there is no C code invovled, we just tell cffi to open a Python portal to the shaderc library</p>

            <p>- Currently, our extension is ready but we remain dependent of cffi.</p>
            <p>- For example, if you want to pass a pointer to a function, you have to use cffi.</p>
            <p>- When using your wrapper, your users shouldn't need to know cffi, it's just a dependancy.</p>
            <p>- So we are going to write a small Python code especially for that.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
            <p>- Let's examine the "compile_into_spirv" function.</p>

            <p>- All functions defined in our extension can be accessed through "lib".</p>
            <p>- If you take a look at the compile line, we can pass pure Python types like int or string and cffi converts it for us.</p>
            <p>- Clean, intuitive...</p>

            <p>- Shaderc returns a pointer to us, we have to tell cffi to convert it to a bytes Python object.</p>
            <p>- We first get back the pointer and the length but we can't directly copy the data to a bytes in Python because bytes type is immutable, so we have to copy data into a bytearray, and pass it to our bytes object.</p>
            <p>- Take a look at the ffi.memmove function, it's similar to the memcpy C function but directly in Python.</p>
